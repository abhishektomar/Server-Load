ServerLoad ----->>

    This is a small application which shows all Servers "Load" and uptime in the browser. It involves two 
    scripts. First is running ssh and gathering the information from servers and writing it in a file.
    Second Script reads the information copied and displays it in browser.

**Note -- By default, For making SSH connection it reads ~/.ssh/config file. Copy your id_rsa.pub to 
 	servers for secure and password less login.

	You can use different path for the application by changing in "config.yaml" file.
	e.g.
	:outputfile: <Path to the outputfile>
	:sshconf: <Path to the ssh conf file>
